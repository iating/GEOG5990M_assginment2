Project background: Since crime will seriously threaten people's property and life safety, especially in areas with higher crime rates in the UK, people's safety is more likely to be threatened. This project specifically examines whether there is a correlation between the number of crimes occurring in different areas of Bradford in April 2021 and the deprivation index. The final result is a visual analysis chart that provides people with relevant references, hoping to have a good preventive and vigilant effect on local people.
